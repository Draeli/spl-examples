Intention
===

The idea is to have you folks add a few choice tidbits of goodness you have stumbled over when using the SPL (Standard PHP Library).

The (not so) secret motivation here is to get some nice examples to go in the PHP documentation. :-)

What to do
===

Use the wiki to add your code, descriptions, thoughts, irritations, whatever.
